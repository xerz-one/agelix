# `agelix`

This is [`agenix`](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix) but with Lix.

Yep.

Just, pretty much that.

I did this because I'm a heavy user of pipe operators and `agenix` quickly complained about that. It relies on the official Lix overlay, as `agenix` looks for the `nix` package on Nixpkgs â€’ thus providing a readily available derivation as a flake that makes life a bit easier!
